#WEDDING ANNIVERSARIES: 
A SMAPI mod that adds anniversary gifts and dialogue to NPC partners

##:: REQUIREMENTS ::
+ SMAPI

##:: FEATURES ::
+ Works with existing marriages
+ Includes special anniversary dialogue
+ Wedding anniversary reminders one week in advance
+ Random gifts unique to each bachelor/bachelorette
+ Default gifts/dialogue for unsupported spouses (should hopefully make this compatible with other mods)
+ Bad gifts/dialogue for spouses at 6-9 hearts

##:: MOD AUTHORS ::
This mod creates a custom anniversary dialogue asset that can be written to with your own Content Patcher mods.
Please see the github page for documentation:

##:: RECOMMENDED MODS  ::
+ Anniversary on Calendar
+ PolyamorySweetLove -- tested now for compatibility!

##::  KNOWN ISSUES ::
+ This mod is relatively resilient, but if you play around with console commands like world_setyear, 
   it may sometimes affect an NPC's stored WeddingDate. If that happens, the anniversary might not trigger
   on the correct day. FWIW, the vast majority of times I ran date/time console commands with this mod active,
   everything was fine.

##::  CREDITS ::
* Atravita, for the clever little idea with the i18n exploit that allowed random gifts to actually work, based on the spouse token
* ApryllForever (author of PolySweet) for her tireless help, working with me to get this mod compatible with hers
* TheMightyAmondee, for creating a custom days married token that I used in the first (CP only) version of this mod
* Mushymato for gently nudging me in the right direction on multiple occasions
