# WeddingAnniversaries
A mod that allows NPC spouses to remember their anniversaries. This is version 2.0 of the mod -- a complete rework from its origins as a Content Patcher mod.

## For Mod Authors
Wedding Anniversaries creates a custom Dialogue asset that can be written to via Content Patcher. If you would like your NPC to have anniversary dialogue, you will need to make the following changes:

1. Add Kantrip.WeddingAnniversaries as a non-required dependency to your manifest.json

```json
"Dependencies": [
    {
        "UniqueID": "Kantrip.WeddingAnniversaries",
        "IsRequired": false,
        "MinimumVersion": "2.0",
    },
]
```

2. Create a dialogue patch with your NPC's name. This will work for vanilla NPCs as well. For example, this will patch the  anniversary reminder, annniversary day message, and anniversary gifts for both Sebastian and for ichortower's Hat Mouse Lacey:

```json
{
    "Action": "EditData",
    "Target": "Mods/Kantrip.WeddingAnniversaries/Dialogue",
    "When": {
        "HasMod": "Kantrip.WeddingAnniversaries",
    },
    "Entries": {
        "Reminder_Sebastian": "Hey um.... you remember that our anniversary is in a week, right?",
        "Anniversary_Sebastian": "Hey... happy anniversary, @.$h",
        "Gifts_Sebastian": "62 72 797 595",

        "Reminder_Lacey": "Our anniversary is next week!$h",
        "Anniversary_Lacey": "Happy anniversary, @.$h",
        "Gifts_Lacey": "StardropTea 221 873 525",
    }
},
```

You can use CP to randomize these keys to your heart's content. WeddingAnniversaries contains a set of five lines for each NPC by default, as well as a gift lift of about eight unique item ids for each of the vanilla spouses.

Here's an example from my dialogue mod, Older Sebastian:
```json
{
    "Action": "EditData",
    "Target": "Mods/Kantrip.WeddingAnniversaries/Dialogue",
    "When": {
        "HasMod": "Kantrip.WeddingAnniversaries",
    },
    "Entries": {
        "Reminder_Sebastian": "{{i18n:OlderSeb.Reminder.{{Random:{{Range:0,2}}}}}}",
        "Anniversary_Sebastian": "{{i18n:OlderSeb.Anniversary.{{Random:{{Range:0,4}}}}}}",
        "Gifts_Sebastian": "{{i18n:OlderSeb.gifts}}",
    }
},
```

## Dialogue Keys
This mod respects the following dialogue keys, where **[NPC]** is the NPC's name (e.g. "Abigail", "Harvey", etc):
* **Reminder_[NPC]** : This is the text that will show a week in advance of the NPC spouse's anniversary with the player
* **Anniversary_[NPC]** : The anniversary day greeting
* **Anniversary_[NPC]_Bad** : The anniversary day greeting if the player is at less than 9 hearts with the NPC spouse
* **Gifts_[NPC]** : A space-separated list of object IDs. One will be randomly selected to give to the player on the anniversary day
* **Gifts_[NPC]_Bad** : A space-separated list of object IDs. This list is used when the player is at less than 9 hearts with the NPC spouse

If a needed dialogue key is not specified, WeddingAnniversaries will fall back on its own list of defaults. This includes generic text and gifts for NPCs that aren't one of the twelve vanilla bachelors/bachelorettes.
